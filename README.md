# Load Data into a Relational Data Warehouse

This lab demonstrates the process of loading data into a relational data warehouse using **Azure Synapse Analytics**. Below is the summary of the tasks I completed during the lab:

## Steps Completed

1. **Set up Azure Synapse Analytics Workspace**  
   Created a new Synapse workspace to provide the necessary environment for data warehousing and loading.

2. **Loaded Data**  
   Imported data from various sources into the data warehouse, ensuring proper data formats and structures.

3. **Loaded Data Warehouse Tables**  
   Created and populated the data warehouse tables with the appropriate data to prepare for analysis.

4. **Used the COPY Statement to Load Data**  
   Leveraged the `COPY` statement to efficiently load data from the data lake to the data warehouse, optimizing performance for large datasets.

5. **Utilized CREATE TABLE AS (CTAS) Statement**  
   Employed the `CREATE TABLE AS` (CTAS) statement to create new tables and perform data processing in a single operation.

6. **Loaded Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Table using INSERT and UPDATE**  
   Combined `INSERT` and `UPDATE` statements to dynamically load and update a Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) table, ensuring accurate historical data tracking.

7. **Optimized Post-Load**  
   Applied optimization techniques to improve query performance and reduce resource usage in the data warehouse.

8. **Cleaned Up Resources**  
   Deleted unnecessary Azure resources to avoid unnecessary costs and maintain a cost-efficient cloud environment.

## Conclusion

This lab provided hands-on experience in managing data loading, transformation, and optimization within **Azure Synapse Analytics**, along with key strategies to control costs in cloud environments.
